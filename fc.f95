!This is the main file and start of the program.
!fc compares two files for their equality.
!Differences is writen to sceen or optionally to a file.

!File names are given as commandline options on start of
!the program. 
!Two first arguments are the names of the files to compare.
!The third argument is optional and if it is given,
!the difference report will be written to file with given name.
!eg. fc file1 file2 reportFile
!If there is an error opening any of the files user will be
!prompted for a new file name.

!Two argument flags is defined as well:
! -l : Will show licence and exit program.
! -h : Will show help text and exit program.
